# The Book Nook Book Mangement App

Hello! My name is Vikram, and I own a small bookstore called The Book Nook. We offer a wide range of books and also have a cozy reading area where customers can relax and enjoy their favorite novels. As my business has grown, I've encountered some challenges that I think a web app could help solve.

## Challenges

- Customer Management:
  I need to keep track of my customers' information, including their contact details and purchase history.
  Right now, I do this manually, which is time-consuming and can lead to mistakes.

- Inventory Management:
  I need to track the books in stock, what gets sold, and when to reorder.
  This helps me avoid running out of popular titles and ensures I have a good variety of books available.

- Order Processing:
  Handling orders manually is difficult and time-consuming.
  I need an automated system to process both online and in-store orders efficiently.

- Communication:
  I need a way to send order confirmations, promotional messages, and event notifications to my customers easily.

- Analytics and Reporting:
  I want to understand sales trends, popular genres, and customer preferences to make better business decisions.
  A simple dashboard with basic reports would be very helpful.
